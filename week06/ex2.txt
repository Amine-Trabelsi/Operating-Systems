Change the macro TRI BASE to a small number like 100 and run
the scheduler again. Compare your results before and after the
change?
for a small TRI BASE the code finds a lot more triangular numbers, and also takes a longer time to run.

Change the arrival time of all processes to make all of them zero,
then run the scheduler again. In which order will processes be
executed?
the processes will run according to the their index order.
